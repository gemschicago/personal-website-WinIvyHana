	<h1> About me </h1>
	<p> Hi! My name is Ivy Chan. I am currently a 10th grader at GEMS World Academy. This is my fourth year at GEMS. I have a little brother named Aaric, who is in seventh grade. My favorite school subject is math. In fact, I used to compete in math competitions.  I am also a competitive squash player and regularly competed in tournaments before COVID-19. I also used to be a competitive swimmer (I was in the top 8 fastest swimmers in Illinois for three events!).</p>

	<p> I used to code JavaScript and Python a few years ago. I participated in YSP (Young Scholars Program), a summer math program that is hosted by the University of Chicago. YSP not only had math lectures, but also included afternoon programming sessions in the afternoon. </p>
