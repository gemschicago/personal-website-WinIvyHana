  <div class="item3">Hi! My name is Ivy Chan! I am a 15-year old and currently a 10th grader at GEMS World Academy. I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do in the next 5 minutes while you're reading this but am excited to discover my "life's path".</div>

  <div class="item5"><img src="IvySquashPIC.mp4" height="200px"></div>
  <div class="item6">I've primarily played two sport in my life so far: swimming and squash. Not the vegetable squash, but the sport. Swimming was basically my life from when I was 9 up until 13. However, the sport took a huge toll on my body. I suffered an overused left shoulder and tendonitis in my right shoulder. I was slowly losing my passion for this sport and focused more on squash. Despite my primary injury during squash was a sprained ankle, I can currently firmly say that I love squash more than swimming. In fact, I am the school's squash team captain and plan on playing in college.</div>

  <div class="item9">I've also played piano for the majority of my life so far. I've practiced up to 6 hours a day and attended competitions. Although I do not compete or practice as much anymore, I occasionally still run my fingers along the keys and just enjoy the pleasure of playing rather than "grinding" to get better.<audio controls>
